title: Dumb static site - Travel bucket list
---

Let's start it out with dumb static site. Right now the plan is to create static site without any inputs or any DB as of now. As of now, I am not much used to coding and launching sites quickly. So my first goal here is to make sure I get the hang of deploying site as ease. <br />

So, here it goes the first idea.

<strong>Abhinam Travel dreams</strong><br >
This will be places me and my wife have on our travel list. Every item will have basic details of that item and what specific activity we want to do. Let's see if we can add 1 sample pic ðŸ¤”
Site will be purely dumb just static site with maybe some re-directs. Lets start with list of items, and on click simply show the description for selected item. 

Basic layout for my site.


<table>
  
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2" style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.5em;">
      Website plan ðŸ“‹
    </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2">Abhinam Travel dreams</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2">A curated list of dream destinations we'd love to explore â€” from hidden gems to iconic landmarks. This is our little corner to track, dream, and get inspired for future adventures. Every place here is a promise to myself: to wander more, to learn deeply, and to never stop exploring</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
      <td colspan="2">Place 1 title</td>
